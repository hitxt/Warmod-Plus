# Warmod Plus
An improved CSGO match system based on [Warmod by versatile_bfg](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=225474).

## Changes
- Colored text.
- RWS ranking system from [splewis's Pug Setup](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-pug-setup).
- PUG system from [splewis's Pug Setup](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-pug-setup).
- Map change delay for GOTV.
- Make more phrases translatable.
- New team system.(Team ranking, custom team logo...etc)
- Rewrited stats system, added rankme style stats. Old stats are wrong and have some bugs.
- Admin pause and admin unpause. (ONLY ADMIN CAN UNPAUSE ADMIN PAUSE.)
- Discord announcement.(match start, match end, match cancel and call player)
- Change game name on steam server browser.
- Show match id in hostname.
- Change defaut T team name and CT team name to "Team A" and "Team B". (I don't know why score messages keep showing blank team name so I make this change.)
- Remove SQL in plugin, now we use web api to save stats and get data.
- C4 countdown and messages. (e.g. "Player A was 0.1s away from defusing!")
- Rewrited damage report, make it easier to configure. (You don't need to edit convars anymore, just simply edit it in phrases.txt)
- Server must have token to use Warmod+ (I made this to prevent some ni**ers steal my work.)
